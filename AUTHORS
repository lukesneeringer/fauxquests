This package contains some code taken from `requests_testadapter`, written
by Łukasz Langa (in particular, see fauxquests/response.py).

In addition to this code, Łukasz's work was instrumental in providing the
understanding needed to make fauxquests, and I am indebted to his efforts,
without which it is likely that fauxquests would not exist.
